# ETL Project : World Happiness and Possible Factors that affect it

## Team Members

# Our Challenge
* The goal of this project was to extract, transform, and load two different datasets into a sql database.

* We each individually loaded a csv file into a pandas dataframe and cleaned the file (renamed columns, dropped columns, etc).  Once we finished cleaning each csv file, we created a connection to the sql database and successfully connected.  Once the connection was made and tables were loaded, we joined the two datasets on a similar column.
