# Our Challenge
* The goal of this project was to extract, transform, and load two different datasets into a sql database.
* We each individually loaded a csv file into a Pandas DataFrame and cleaned the file (renamed columns, dropped columns, etc).  
* Once we finished cleaning each csv file, we created a table with matching column names in SQL, created a connection to the SQL database and successfully connected.  
* Once the connection was made and tables were loaded, we joined the various datasets on a similar column (e.g. country.
